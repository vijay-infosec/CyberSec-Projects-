# ANY.RUN Malware Analysis – RedLine Stealer Variant

This lab analyzes a suspicious ZIP → MSI → EXE sample using the ANY.RUN cloud sandbox.  
The objective is to identify malware behavior, network activity, process tree structure,  
MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

---

## 🔍 Summary of Findings
- The extracted executable behaves as **RedLine Stealer / Mikey** malware.
- High-risk verdict with malicious activity confirmed.
- Process execution chain indicates staged execution and potential evasion.
- Strong network indicators observed, including communication with known malicious IPs.
- PowerShell-based anti-forensics behavior detected.

## 🧪 Behavioral Analysis

### **Process Tree**
- Initial installer spawns **crypted.exe** → secondary payload.
- Execution chain exhibits traits of loader-style malware.
- Process scoring and anomalies flagged by ANY.RUN.

### **Network Activity**
- Outbound connection to **171.22.28.236**, flagged malicious by 11 vendors.
- Typical RedLine C2-style communication behavior.
- Network telemetry supports classification as credential/crypto stealer malware.

### **Anti-Forensics & Execution Techniques**
- PowerShell launched with:
  - `-NoProfile`
  - `-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
  - Script self-deletion and cleanup behavior.
- Indicates anti-analysis intent and trace removal.

## 🧲 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Techniques observed or inferred from behavior:

- **T1059** – Command Execution  
- **T1059.001** – PowerShell  
- **T1105** – Ingress Tool Transfer  
- **T1027** – Obfuscated Files or Information  
- **T1070** – Indicator Removal / Anti-Forensics  
- **T1083** – File and Directory Discovery
