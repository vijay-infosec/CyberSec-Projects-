# Cuckoo Sandbox Malware Analysis

This lab demonstrates dynamic and static analysis of a malware sample using Cuckoo Sandbox.  
The analysis includes API behavior, memory inspection, obfuscation detection, AV scoring,  
and extraction of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

---

## 🔍 **Objectives**
- Execute malware safely in an isolated sandbox
- Capture process behavior and API calls
- Detect memory injection techniques
- Analyze PE structure for signs of obfuscation
- Review antivirus engines & signature matches
- Extract IOCs for threat intelligence
- Map behavior to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

---

## 🧪 **Analysis Summary**

### **1. Behavior Analysis**
- Malware executed via **rundll32.exe**
- Cuckoo captured suspicious calls including:
  - `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`
  - `NtProtectVirtualMemory`
- Evidence of **RWX (Read-Write-Execute) memory pages** often used for shellcode injection

### **2. Static Indicators**
- PE file showed abnormal section entropy
- Obfuscation detected:
  - **CryptoObfuscator** patterns identified
- High-risk AV detections in IRMA (38 vendors flagged)

### **3. Network & System Activity**
- Cuckoo reported attempts to:
  - Modify registry run keys
  - Create or rename files
  - Contact external IPs (failed due to isolation)

### **4. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**
Commonly identified techniques:
- **T1055** – Process Injection  
- **T1027** – Obfuscated/Encrypted Files  
- **T1112** – Modify Registry  
- **T1059** – Command Execution
