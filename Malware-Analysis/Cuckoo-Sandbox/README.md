# Cuckoo Sandbox Malware Analysis

This lab demonstrates dynamic and static analysis of a malware sample using the Cuckoo Sandbox automated analysis environment.  
The analysis includes behavioral monitoring, static inspection, obfuscation indicators, and identification of indicators of compromise (IOCs).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Execute malware safely in an isolated sandbox  
- Capture behavioral indicators and API calls  
- Discover process activity and persistence methods  
- Analyze static properties of the file for obfuscation  
- Extract IOCs for detection and reporting  
- Map behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

## 🧪 Analysis Summary

### **1. Behavioral Analysis**
Key findings include:

- Malware executed with elevated privileges    
- Suspicious file and registry operations  
- High-threat score from Cuckoo Sandbox (10/10)

### **2. Static Indicators**
Static analysis revealed:

- High entropy suggesting obfuscation  
- Packed/obfuscated sections  
- Suspicious resource and PE metadata  
- Unusual compile timestamp

### **3. System Activity (No Network Traffic Observed)**

During dynamic execution, the malware did not generate any outbound network traffic.  
This indicates one of the following conditions:

- The sample may require command-line arguments or specific triggers  
- The malware might perform environment checks and disable network behaviour inside sandboxes  
- It may be a non-networking variant focusing on local system modification  
- Network activity may occur only under certain user actions or time delays  

Cuckoo still captured local system behaviors including:

- File system modifications  
- Registry interaction attempts  
- Process creation events

### **4. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**
Based on observed behavior, the sample aligns with:

- **T1059 – Command Execution**  
- **T1105 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**  
- **T1027 – Obfuscated/Encrypted Files**  
- **T1082 – System Information Discovery**  

*(Mapping is based on analysis findings; screenshot not required.)*
