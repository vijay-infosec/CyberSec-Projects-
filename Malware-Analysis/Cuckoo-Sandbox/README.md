# Cuckoo Sandbox Malware Analysis

This lab demonstrates dynamic and static analysis of a malware sample using the Cuckoo Sandbox automated analysis environment.  
The analysis includes behavioral monitoring, static inspection, obfuscation indicators, and identification of indicators of compromise (IOCs).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Execute malware safely in an isolated sandbox  
- Capture behavioral indicators and API calls  
- Discover process activity and persistence methods  
- Analyze static properties of the file for obfuscation  
- Extract IOCs for detection and reporting  
- Map behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  

---

## 🧪 Analysis Summary

### **1. Behavioral Analysis**
Key findings include:

- Malware executed with elevated privileges  
- Network activity observed (HTTP communication)  
- Suspicious file and registry operations  
- High-threat score from Cuckoo Sandbox (10/10)  

📸 **Screenshot:**

---

### **2. Static Indicators**
Static analysis revealed:

- High entropy suggesting obfuscation  
- Packed/obfuscated sections  
- Suspicious resource and PE metadata  
- Unusual compile timestamp

---

### **3. Network & System Activity**
- Outbound network attempts detected  
- Registry modification behavior  
- Dropped files captured during execution  

*(No screenshot required — textual explanation is sufficient.)*

---

### **4. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**
Based on observed behavior, the sample aligns with:

- **T1059 – Command Execution**  
- **T1105 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**  
- **T1027 – Obfuscated/Encrypted Files**  
- **T1082 – System Information Discovery**  

*(Mapping is based on analysis findings; screenshot not required.)*
